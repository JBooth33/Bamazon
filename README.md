# Bamazon

Bamazon Customer allows a customer to peruse a list of products in the terminal and purchase the items.  Once they select the product and the quantity they want, then they receive the total cost of their purchase.

Bamazon Manager allows a manager to update their inventory.  The manager can view current inventory, view products that are low in inventory, order more of an existing product or even add a new product to inventory.
